    <p>RE: Majority-to-Minority Transfer Status for Confirmation Number: {{ submission.confirmationNumber }}</p>

    <p>Your application for a Majority-to-Minority Student Transfer for {{ submission.firstName }} {{ submission.lastName }} for {{ submission.enrollmentPeriod }} has been approved for the following two choices:</p>

    <div>
        <p>Your student can be Wait Listed for his/her first choice: <strong>{{ waitListedSchool.formattedString }}</strong>. Should additional spaces become available at <strong>{{ waitListedSchool.formattedString }}</strong>, those spaces will be filled by students on the Wait List based on each studentâ€™s lottery number.  If spaces become available at <strong>{{ waitListedSchool.formattedString }}</strong> and your student is selected for a space based on his/her lottery number, our office will contact you and award your student a space at this school. Please note that the Wait List expires on July 15, {{ submission.enrollmentPeriod.afterLotteryEndingDate|date("Y") }}.</p>

        <p>Your student has been accepted for placement at his/her second choice: <strong>{{ submission.awardedSchoolID.formattedString }}</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>You may only choose one of the above options.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>You have two choices for accepting or declining one of the options above:</strong></p>
    <div>
        <p>You may go online at <strong>{{ url( 'stw_lottery_accept' , { uniqueID: submission.url } ) }}</strong> to accept or decline your option.</p>
        <p>You may call the TCS Attendance Office at 205-759-3700, Monday-Friday between 8:30am and 4:00pm, for instructions regarding accepting or declining by phone.</p>
